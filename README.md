This challenge is to build out the e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
Add items to the cart
View the cart and remove items from it

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
